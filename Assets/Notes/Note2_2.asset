  text: "Eighteenth sleep time since April 17th AD 1148\r\n\r\nI have put up a doubt
    that we cannot stay here for much longer. I know that revealing the secret of
    the artifact is the only hope for Daegel. I see this in his eyes, in his movement.
    But Elric already thinks about something else. He does not believe in the power
    of the artifact. Like many others. Perhaps they are right. Daegal does not want
    to hear me. He says his close. I do not understand the signs like him. Well,
    I have never understood his studies anyway. But I believe he will make the right
    choice.\r"

  text: "November 7th, afternoon\r\n\r\nUnbelievable! Scouts who left maybe two weeks
    ago have come back this morning and brought two young witches. We can finally
    banish the monster to hell and leave these horrible caves for good.\r\nI have
    seen these girls for a brief moment but one of them is truly\u2026 beautiful.
    How come such divine creatures give themselves to the devil? I don't understand\u2026
    but maybe I will. Tonight I guard their prison. Maybe I will overhear something\u2026\r"

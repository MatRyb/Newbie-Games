  text: "7th of May AD 1148\r\n\r\nWe made it. Immediately after leaving I felt\u2026
    differently. Now we are lost in the labyrinth and I am writing this while Elric
    tries to set another path. I do not know if Daegel went after us, if he even
    saw our absence. Less people came with us than I expected. I pray for finding
    a way out.\r"

  text: "November 5th, evening\r\n\r\nHad a busy day and hoped for a little rest
    for most of it, but now, when I have time for myself, I can't sleep. Father wanted
    me to escort scouts to the exit and we met quite a lot of unpleasant events,
    starting with landslide, to a blocked path which we had to uncover, and finally
    some lost blind animals from the depths, which gravely wounded one of the scouts.
    It was just too much for a single trip. Father says that's because the monster
    is nervous. He knows something is going to happen.\r\nI can say I feel the same,
    somehow.\r"

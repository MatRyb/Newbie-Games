  text: "6th of May AD 1148\r\n\r\nWe are leaving them behind. I hate myself for
    that and I hope God will forgive us, but something strange has happened to them.
    They are not themselves anymore. We cannot stay here forever and Daegel seems
    to think just that. He does not sleep nor eat, just study the signs. I talked
    to Conrad, in vain. He understands us, he does not know what Daegel is up to,
    but he will not help us. Daegel does not even have the time to talk to his own
    brother. We will leave today, in the sleep time. A lot of people will come with
    us, I hope.\r"

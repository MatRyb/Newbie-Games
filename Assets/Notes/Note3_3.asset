  text: "November 8th, early morning\r\n\r\nHave we made a mistake? I have heard
    everything they were saying tonight and I do not believe they are witches anymore.
    Their life has been so cruel and full of pain, that I could not stop tears. I
    truly think they were telling the truth. In the end I revealed myself to them
    and asked if their story had been true. And so the sacrifice will not suffice.
    But I know my father will not believe me, nobody will. I need to do something
    alone. Something. Anything.\r"

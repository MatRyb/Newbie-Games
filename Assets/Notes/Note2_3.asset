  text: "5th of May AD 1148\r\n\r\nElric has given Daegel one more day to uncover
    the secret of the writing. They both realized that people need a break anyway.
    That day has passed, yet Daegel, who worked through night and day does not seem
    fond of leaving. I want to leave. I have told Elric. I feel weird here. This
    artifact\u2026 I believe it holds some power. I feel it. And I do not want to
    know it. Elric wants to give his brother a chance and I love him too, but I am
    afraid we will all pay for that chance.\r"

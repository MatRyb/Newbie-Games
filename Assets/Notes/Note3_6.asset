  text: "November 9th, evening\r\n\r\nI am sorry, Father. I know you trusted me.
    I just hope everything will turn out all right. This is what you made me to live
    like. Maybe in time you will understand my actions.\r\nI love you deeply. I do.
    We might never meet again but I leave you this diary so you will be able to always
    look into my mind and be with me. I can just carry the memory of you with me,
    but I think it will be enough. I know it will.\r\n\r\nFarewell,\r\nArne\r"

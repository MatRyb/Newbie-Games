  text: "Sixteenth sleep time since April 17th AD 1148\r\n\r\nWe have stopped for
    a rest. People are tired and not just because of wandering for many hours. Beatriz
    told me earlier that she does not want to go on. I looked at her eyes in the
    torch\u2019s light and without a word I took her bag. Daegal says that these
    tunnels had to have some other purpose than mining and I believe him. People
    are strifing farther in the chamber, I will go and see. I think they have found
    something.\r"
